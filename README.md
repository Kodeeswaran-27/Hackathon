	"inputs": "Give me a decent litigation strategy for the following in 50 words and don't include the prompt I sent. Your client, a multinational technology company, is facing a patent infringement lawsuit filed by a competitor. The competitor claims that your client's latest product infringes upon their patented technology. Your client believes that they have not infringed upon the competitor's patent and wants to defend their position in court. Develop a litigation strategy outlining the key arguments, evidence, and legal tactics that can be employed to successfully defend your client against the patent infringement allegations. Consider the strengths and weaknesses of both parties' positions, potential counterclaims, expert witnesses, and any relevant legal precedents or statutes that can support your client's defense. Provide a comprehensive plan for pre-trial preparation, discovery, motion practice, trial strategy, and potential settlement negotiations, if applicable. Your strategy should aim to protect your client's interests, minimize potential damages, and achieve a favorable outcome in the litigation. ",
